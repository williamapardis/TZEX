# Twilight Zone Explorer - TZEx
[TZEX](https://twilightzone.whoi.edu/twilight-zone-explorer-or-tzex/) is a autonomous oceanographic sediment trap designed by [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](whoi.edu) to integrate with [NKE Instruement's](https://nke-instrumentation.com/) profiling floats. This repository is dedicated to the custom embedded electronics developed for motor control and logic on the float. This solely consists of a single custom printed circuit board.
